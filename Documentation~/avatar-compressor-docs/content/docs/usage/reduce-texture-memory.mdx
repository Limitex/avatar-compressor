This tutorial shows you how to reduce your avatar's texture memory usage using the Texture Compressor component.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the Component

1. Select your avatar's root GameObject (the one with VRC Avatar Descriptor)
2. Click **Add Component** in the Inspector
3. Search for "LAC" and add **LAC Texture Compressor**

</Step>

<Step>
### Choose a Preset

<Tabs items={['Quality', 'Balanced', 'Aggressive']}>
<Tab value="Quality">
**For PC avatars where you want minimal quality loss.**

- VRAM Reduction: 20-40%
- Quality Impact: Minimal
- Best for: Showcase avatars, detailed textures

</Tab>
<Tab value="Balanced">
**Good balance between quality and file size. (Recommended)**

- VRAM Reduction: 40-60%
- Quality Impact: Slight
- Best for: Most avatars

</Tab>
<Tab value="Aggressive">
**Strong compression for Quest avatars or limited VRAM.**

- VRAM Reduction: 60-80%
- Quality Impact: Noticeable
- Best for: Quest avatars, performance-critical situations

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
For your first time, start with **Balanced**. You can always adjust later.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Preview Results

Click **Preview Compression Results** in the Inspector to see what will happen:

| Metric         | Description                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Complexity** | Higher (closer to 1.0) = more detailed texture |
| **Size**       | Original resolution → new resolution           |
| **Format**     | Compression format that will be applied        |

</Step>

<Step>
### Fine-tune (Optional)

If you see a texture that needs special treatment, click the **Freeze** button:

| Setting              | Use When                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Skip compression** | Keep the texture completely unchanged |
| **Divisor**          | Manually control resolution reduction |
| **Format**           | Override the compression format       |

<Callout type="warn">
Consider freezing these textures:
- Face textures with fine details
- Textures with small text or logos
- Emission maps with gradient effects

</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Build and Compare

1. Build your avatar normally through VRChat SDK
2. Check the new **Download Size** and **VRAM** values
3. Upload to VRChat and test in-game

</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Textures look blurry">
- Use a less aggressive preset (e.g., Quality instead of Balanced)
- Freeze specific textures that look bad
- Increase the **Min Resolution** in Custom preset

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Not enough compression">
- Try a more aggressive preset
- Disable **Process Normal Maps** if normals don't need compression
- Lower the **High Complexity Threshold** in Custom preset

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Some textures aren't being processed">
Check if they're being skipped due to:
- Size filters (texture is too small)
- Type filters (texture type is disabled)
- Path exclusions (asset path matches exclusion pattern)

</Accordion>
</Accordions>
