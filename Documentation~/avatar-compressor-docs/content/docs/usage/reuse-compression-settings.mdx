This tutorial shows you how to create and use custom presets to share compression settings across multiple avatars.

## When to Use Custom Presets

Custom presets are useful when you want to:

- Apply the same settings to multiple avatars
- Create platform-specific configurations (PC vs Quest)
- Share settings with other creators
- Fine-tune beyond the built-in presets

## Creating a Custom Preset

<Steps>
<Step>
### Configure Your Settings

1. Add **LAC Texture Compressor** to your avatar
2. Select the **Custom** preset
3. Adjust settings until you're happy with the results

<Callout type="info">
Use **Preview Compression Results** to verify your settings before saving.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Save as Preset

1. Click the **+** button next to the preset field
2. Choose a save location (e.g., `Assets/Presets/`)
3. Name your preset (e.g., "MyPCSettings")

Your current settings are now saved as a reusable asset.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Menu Path

Select your new preset asset in the Project window and set:

| Field           | Example               | Description                      |
| --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Menu Path**   | `My Presets/PC`       | Where it appears in the dropdown |
| **Menu Order**  | `100`                 | Lower values appear first        |
| **Description** | `High quality for PC` | Shown when preset is selected    |

<Callout type="info">
Only presets with a Menu Path appear in the dropdown menu.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Use on Other Avatars

1. Add **LAC Texture Compressor** to another avatar
2. Select **Custom** preset
3. Click the **Custom Preset** button and select your saved preset

The settings are applied automatically.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Use Cases

<Tabs items={['PC and Quest', 'Multiple Avatars', 'Sharing']}>
<Tab value="PC and Quest">
**Create separate presets for each platform.**

| Preset Name     | Menu Path         | Settings                           |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| PC High Quality | `Platforms/PC`    | Quality preset + higher resolution |
| Quest Optimized | `Platforms/Quest` | Aggressive preset + ASTC formats   |

Switch between them when building for different platforms.

</Tab>

<Tab value="Multiple Avatars">
**Share consistent settings across your avatar collection.**

1. Create a preset with your preferred settings
2. Apply it to all your avatars
3. Update the preset once to update all avatars

Changes to the preset automatically apply to all linked avatars.

</Tab>

<Tab value="Sharing">
**Distribute presets to other creators.**

1. Create and configure your preset
2. Enable **Lock** to prevent accidental changes
3. Share the `.asset` file

Recipients can import and use it immediately.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Built-in Plus Presets

Avatar Compressor includes intermediate presets that provide finer control:

| Preset          | Use When                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Quality+**    | Quality is too strong, High Quality is too light |
| **Balanced+**   | Balanced is too strong, Quality is too light     |
| **Aggressive+** | Aggressive is too strong, Balanced is too light  |

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access Plus Presets

1. Select **Custom** preset on the component
2. Click the **Custom Preset** button
3. Find them under **Built-in** category

</Step>
</Steps>

## Tips

- **Lock Important Presets**: Enable the **Lock** field on presets you don't want accidentally modified.
- **Organize with Menu Paths**: Use folder-style paths like `PC/Quality` or `Quest/Optimized` to organize presets.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Add a **Description** so you remember what each preset is for.

For details on these settings, see the [Texture Compressor Reference](../../components/texture-compressor#custom-presets).

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Preset doesn't appear in dropdown">
- Check that **Menu Path** is set on the preset asset
- Verify the preset file exists and isn't corrupted
- Try closing and reopening the Inspector
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't edit the preset">
The preset may be restricted:

- **Locked**: Disable the Lock field on the preset asset
- **Built-in**: These are read-only; click **Edit** then **Unlink** to copy settings
- **External Package**: Same as built-in; unlink to edit locally

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes aren't saved">
- Click **Save** to write changes to the linked preset
- If the preset is restricted, changes only apply locally
- Use **Unlink** if you want to keep local changes without affecting the preset
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
