title: LAC Texture Compressor
description: Complexity-based texture compression component
---

Texture Compressor analyzes avatar textures and compresses them based on their complexity. Complex textures (detailed patterns, text) receive less compression, while simple textures (solid colors, gradients) receive more compression.

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the Component

1. Select your avatar's root GameObject (the one with the VRC Avatar Descriptor)
2. In the Inspector, click **Add Component**
3. Navigate to **Avatar Compressor > LAC Texture Compressor**, or search for "Texture Compressor"

</Step>
<Step>

### Select a Preset

Choose a preset that matches your needs.

<Callout type="info">
**Balanced** is recommended for most avatars.
</Callout>
</Step>
<Step>
### Build Your Avatar

Build your avatar normally through VRChat SDK. The component automatically:

1. Analyzes all textures in your avatar
2. Calculates compression level for each texture based on complexity
3. Creates compressed copies (originals remain untouched)
4. Updates materials to use compressed textures

</Step>
</Steps>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Built-in Custom Presets

In addition to the main presets above, intermediate presets are available via the Custom Preset dropdown:

| Preset            | Position                         | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **High Quality+** | Higher quality than High Quality | Maximum quality with minimal processing       |
| **Quality+**      | Between High Quality and Quality | Higher quality than Quality, less compression |
| **Balanced+**     | Between Quality and Balanced     | Higher quality than Balanced                  |
| **Aggressive+**   | Between Balanced and Aggressive  | Higher quality than Aggressive                |
| **Maximum+**      | Between Aggressive and Maximum   | Higher quality than Maximum                   |

These presets provide finer control when the main presets don't quite match your needs.

## Texture Filters

Control which texture types are processed:

| Filter                     | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Process Main Textures**  | Color/albedo textures (`_MainTex`, `_BaseMap`, etc.) |
| **Process Normal Maps**    | Normal/bump maps (`_BumpMap`, `_NormalMap`, etc.)    |
| **Process Emission Maps**  | Emission textures (`_EmissionMap`, etc.)             |
| **Process Other Textures** | Metallic, roughness, and other textures              |

### Path Exclusions

Textures from specific asset paths can be excluded from compression. This is useful for:

- Excluding textures from tools that generate temporary assets
- Preserving textures from specific packages that shouldn't be modified

By default, the following paths are excluded:

| Path                         | Description        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `Packages/com.vrcfury.temp/` | VRCFury temp files |

You can add custom path prefixes in the component inspector under **Path Exclusions**. Any texture whose asset path starts with one of these prefixes will be skipped.

## Preview

Click **Preview Compression Results** in the Inspector to see compression analysis before building.

### Search and Filter

Use the search box at the top of the preview to filter textures by name:

- **Standard search**: Type any part of the texture name to filter the list (case-insensitive)
- **Fuzzy search**: Click the "Fuzzy" button to enable fuzzy matching, which allows up to 1 character tolerance for typos

When searching, the section headers show filtered counts (e.g., "Preview (3/10 shown)") and hidden texture counts.

### Summary

The preview shows total size statistics:

| Metric           | Description                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Original**     | Total uncompressed size of all textures |
| **After**        | Estimated size after compression        |
| **Savings**      | Percentage and bytes saved              |
| **Memory (Est)** | Estimated VRAM usage after compression  |

### Texture List

For each texture, the preview displays:

- **Texture thumbnail** - Click to highlight the texture in the Project window
- **Texture name and type** (Main, Normal, Emission, Other)
- **Complexity score** (0.0 - 1.0) with visual progress bar
- **Size change** - Original resolution → Recommended resolution (with divisor)
- **Predicted format** - Expected compression format (e.g., BC7, DXT5, ASTC_4x4)
- **Freeze button** - Click to freeze the texture with manual override settings (see [Frozen Textures](#frozen-textures))

<Callout type="info">
  Clicking on a texture thumbnail is a quick way to locate and select the
  texture asset in your Project window.
</Callout>

### Complexity Score Interpretation

| Score     | Level     | Compression               |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| < 0.2     | Very Low  | Heavy compression applied |
| 0.2 - 0.4 | Low       | Suitable for compression  |
| 0.4 - 0.6 | Medium    | Moderate compression      |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | High      | Light compression only    |
| ≥ 0.8     | Very High | Minimal compression       |

### Skipped Textures

Textures that won't be processed are shown separately with skip reasons:

- **Too small**: Texture is smaller than the minimum size threshold
- **Filtered by type**: Texture type is disabled in filters
- **User frozen (skipped)**: Texture is frozen with "Skip compression" enabled
- **Runtime generated**: Texture has no asset path (dynamically created during build)
- **Excluded path**: Texture's asset path matches a path exclusion pattern

<Callout type="info">
  The preview does not update automatically. If settings change after generating
  a preview, a warning will appear prompting you to click the button again to
  refresh.
</Callout>

## Frozen Textures

Frozen textures allow you to manually override compression settings for specific textures. This is useful when:

- Automatic compression is too aggressive for an important texture
- You want to preserve a specific texture at full quality
- You need to use a specific compression format for certain textures

### Freezing a Texture

1. Click **Preview Compression Results** to analyze your textures
2. Find the texture you want to freeze in the list
3. Click the **Freeze** button next to the texture

The texture will be moved to the "Frozen Textures" section with manual controls.

### Frozen Texture Settings

For each frozen texture, you can configure:

| Setting              | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skip compression** | When enabled, the texture is completely excluded from compression |
| **Divisor**          | Manual resolution divisor (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16)                     |
| **Format**           | Compression format override (Auto, DXT1, DXT5, BC5, BC7, ASTC)    |

<Callout type="info">
  When **Skip compression** is enabled, the Divisor and Format settings are
  disabled since the texture won't be processed.
</Callout>

### Available Formats

| Format       | Description                   | Platform |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| **Auto**     | Automatic format selection    | All      |
| **DXT1**     | RGB only, 4 bpp (efficient)   | Desktop  |
| **DXT5**     | RGBA, 8 bpp (with alpha)      | Desktop  |
| **BC5**      | Normal maps, 8 bpp            | Desktop  |
| **BC7**      | Highest quality, 8 bpp        | Desktop  |
| **ASTC_4x4** | Mobile highest quality, 8 bpp | Mobile   |
| **ASTC_6x6** | Mobile balanced, 3.56 bpp     | Mobile   |
| **ASTC_8x8** | Mobile efficient, 2 bpp       | Mobile   |

### Unfreezing a Texture

To remove manual override and return to automatic compression:

1. Find the texture in the **Frozen Textures** section
2. Click the **Unfreeze** button

The texture will return to normal automatic processing.

<Callout type="warn">
  If a frozen texture's asset file is moved or deleted, a warning will appear in
  the Frozen Textures section. You should unfreeze such textures to clean up the
  list.
</Callout>

## Custom Presets

Custom Presets allow you to save compression settings as reusable ScriptableObject assets. This is useful for:

- Sharing settings across multiple avatars
